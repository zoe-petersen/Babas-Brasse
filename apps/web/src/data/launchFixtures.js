        "Shane van der Hoven is a poet, scholar, and translator. They are completing their PhD at UCTâ€™s School for Languages and Literatures and are a co-editor at the multilingual literary magazine, New Contrast.",
        "JENNIFER TO EDIT THE COLLECTIONâ€™S DESCRIPTION.",
        "Kruiper-Crawler is described as a collection of poetry unlike any other due to its queer, radical, multi-segmented subject matter. The collectionâ€™s thirty-something poems are presented both in Afrikaans and English, the translations differing, interfering with, or sometimes even contradicting each other. Kruiper-Crawler sees Shane van der Hoven explore both the sprawling lowveld and the decaying South African city through the metaphor of the Biblical crawler â€“ the grotesque, misunderstood, and unfairly maligned creatures of the earth and scrubland. Infested with irony and literary allusion, Kruiper-Crawlerâ€™s exoskeleton may seem tough and spiny. But break through to its soft interior, and find yourself in a world of self-doubt and linguistic uncertainty, a deep love of the unknown, and, at its core, a young poet discovering what kind of creature they might be.",
        "With its rave reviews and ? , Kruiper-Crawler has been shortlisted for the University of Johannesburg Debut Prize for Afrikaans. In a particularly strong year for poetry, Shane has been shortlisted alongside Jennifer Pape and Klara du Plessis."

        "Zizi Masizana, emerging theatremaker and actress, explains the concept of â€œPeer Cheerâ€",
        "In January this year, I applied to Theatre Artsâ€™ call-out for its inaugural â€œDeveloping Writers to Write on Theatreâ€ workshop â€“ a great opportunity for me as both a theatre-maker and actress to make sense of a growing concern within my own practice and observations around theatre. As part of the application, I was tasked to articulate my understanding of what the value of theatre reviewing. With that question in mind, I reflected on the absence of sustained, rigorous critical engagement within contemporary South African theatre on the part of audiences.",
        "I, thereafter, reflected on my observations as a university student and emerging theatre-maker, and coined the term â€œpeer cheerâ€ as a persistent, unexamined approval within theatre-making communities. I made sense of â€œpeer cheerâ€ as the reflexive affirmation that replaces true critique within theatre. Peer cheer refers to the generous applause and the obligatory standing ovations of audiences at the end of a performance. This is a language of support that often stops the true interrogation of theatre, and in many cases, it impedes any serious emotional or critical engagement at all.",
        "I am not describing the way audiences or â€œpeer cheerâ€ as being a malicious act. These reactions often come from care, scarcity, and the need for artists to hold one another up in an already fragile ecosystem. We show up for one another because we understand how difficult it is to make work at all. But this support becomes limiting when it replaces honest critical engagement. If artists, who are not lay spectators, respond only with affirmation, then the work is protected from the very critique that could help it grow.",
        "As an emerging artist, and as in my observations watching theatre, I have noticed that theatre is still predominantly inaccessible to many South Africans, thus resulting in those who do generally show up to productions doing so because they are supportive friends, family, and colleagues.",
        "Inadvertently, a ripple effect is created, and theatre is therefore made to please institutions and their overarching power structures, for peers, for industry insiders, for those already within. The audiences in these cases are familiar, predictable, and contained, resulting in the distortion of the role of the audience and consequently the integrity of the craft. Audiences donâ€™t feel or behave as active witnesses or participants in meaning-making, but instead are extensions of the creative community. Audiences are too sympathetic toward the craft of theatre-makers and performers alike, whoever the individual they have shown up to support is. Oftentimes, applauding for the sake of applauding, without being thoroughly engaged or gripped by the work. More often than not, they are reluctant to disrupt the atmosphere, especially when audiences have already shown up to support the artists they came to see.",
        "Meanwhile, and on the opposite end of the spectrum, another audience is quietly taking precedence: funders, gatekeepers, selection panels, and institutional bodies. We are seemingly expected to orient our work toward gaining approval rather than actively engaging and encountering our craft. Each of us, in theatremaking, is indirectly auditioning for proximity to someone with a seat at the table, who will mention our names in rooms we are yet to enter. Applications, proposals, and theatre to its core then becomes a compliance framework, shaped by the aesthetic and conceptual direction of theatre corporately, more than the communities from which it emerges or the publics it seeks to engage.",
        "There is a dissonance.",
        "Theatre is a public art form. Particularly in the South African context: one which should reflect, challenge, and engage with our nuanced society â€“ yet, much of the work circuits within limited loops of validation from other artists, funders, boards, and panels."

        "What does this actually mean?",
        "Although Michael S. Kimmel appears to have used the phrase â€œdecentering menâ€ as early as 1992, he used it to argue that scholars should study men as gendered social actors rather than assuming that menâ€™s experiences represent a universal human experience. In 2019, however, Sherese â€œCharlieâ€ Taylor reconfigured the phrase into a contemporary feminist framework and self-help practice. According to her, the concept of â€œdecentring menâ€ refers to prioritising your own needs and happiness as a woman, and unlearning the societal conditioning that encourages women to alter their appearance, behaviour, and desires to accommodate men and prioritise male comfort and ego.",
        "Decentring men does not mean you should hate men, or should you spit in their faces when they speak â€“ it just means that men are no longer the primary audience of our existence as women. To put it in simpler terms, decentring men is putting your needs above the needs of a man."

At that time, children my age were talking about who they were going to be playing marbles with and what food they were going to eat at lunch. I'm spending my last period of lunch thinking about who I am going to sit with. The Cape Malay girls with shiny, sleek black hair sat in one corner, and the girls with braids and cornrows sat in another corner. The boys never seemed to be worried about hair; they were more concerned about who played soccer best.",
        "The girls never said anything, but who needed words when side eyes spoke the loudest? I remember as I walked out to the playground, a group of girls with middle parts in loose ponytails snickered as I walked towards them. I turned myself right around and received the same rejection from girls in tight cornrows. In that light, I received either not being Black enough or not being Coloured enough. My tight, coily curly hair was too thick to be considered Coloured, and my accent was too thick to be considered Black. That's when I resorted to the fat, racially obtuse character that kept everyone laughing or entertained instead of questioning where I belonged.",

As excited as I was, sitting in that black leather salon chair, I couldnâ€™t help but stick out like a sore thumb. Looking in the mirror in front of me, with the shrinkage of my hair looking back at me, I turned over to the right and the left and realized I slapped me. All the women around me had a uniform look: they were all coloured with straight hair. It was at that moment that an unspoken standard stood out, and it was clear as day that I didnâ€™t particularly fit that standard.",

She reinforced that the term Coloured was not only about the texture of my hair, but also the culture that surrounded me. However, I still chased after acceptance. Even though yes, I was a mixed-race Coloured woman with a Coloured mother from ?, and a Black father from Zimbabwe â€“ a long story for another published piece -- I never thought that my hair in its natural coily state screamed Coloured, so instead of thinking there were different types of Coloured, I just believed what I saw.",
        "In our Coloured community, there has always been this silent notion that hair was the gatekeeper of your identity. During the early 2000s, it was socially embedded that the way you style it, dye it, or even comb it spoke volumes about the image you wanted to portray â€“ my flat-ironed hair, at the time, spoke to the representation that ???.

Still, authentic self-expression is questioned, and often made to feel strange. Underneath the layers of these false identities lies the heavy pressure of cultural expectations, digital surveillance, as well as the constant desire to be seen, heard, and considered, and we are being consumed by it. And as a result, the systems of society that govern us force us to pack away and limit our uniqueness and authenticity. We make ourselves palatable and small by hiding the parts that are deemed unacceptable.",

        "What is it about being authentic that is so intimidating and unsettling?",
        "From an early age, I'd like to think I've always known who I was meant to be. The younger version of me was always so expressive â€“ an effeminate, little black boy from the outskirts of Mdantsane, Eastern Cape, who was never afraid to be himself despite being alienated by those who were around him. I have always been fascinated by movies, and everything to do with having to imagine and live in a world that was beyond reality. As a child, I always enjoyed recreating the worlds of all the cartoons and other kids tv shows I watched. I enjoyed it because it really allowed me to dream beyond what I was always told was possible, and it felt as though in those worlds, I could do and be anything I wanted to be. It also gave me a break from my actual reality of being bullied as a child, amoungst other traumatic events. I guess it was always a way to cope with it all. I had a very creative imagination, and in my primary school days, my teaches used to always tell me they enjoyed reading my creative writing because I was a very expressive learner, even externally. I was a smart child throughout my primary school days, always amongst the top 3 in the grade. I was often described me as creative, and very particular in how I spoke and carried myself. They always told me I carried this 'quiet' confidence that was subtle but very evident. Very disciplined, quiet and well-behaved and never without a smile. Life changed when I turned thirteen, and the pressure to conform became heavier, so heavy to the point where that little feminine boy was forced into hibernation for the duration of what was to be my high school and teenage years. This seemingly drasic shift for me came just before I had to enroll in high school.",
        "Being authentic and true to myself became dangerous because of the conservative environment that I had began to realize I was in, and it was all I had ever known at that time. I had never been outside of the Eastern Cape, except for the one time in grade seven, where we went to a week long marimba competition in Johannesburg, and the other time in grade 8 where i went on a marimba tour in Germany in the following year. High school was probably one of the most horrible and traumatic experiences I have ever had to date. The bullying was extremely brutal. It was physical, mental and emotional, and as a result, I was heavily depressed throughout. When I look back now, I always wonder how I managed to survive that environment. I was othered because I was skinny, feminine and I had a 'girly' voice. It felt as though I was thrown into the middle of the dessert and I had to find a way to survive, and somehow I managed. The high school I went to was in the suburbs of East London, most of the male teenagers there were very obsessed with sport, the gym, having a girlfriend and anything that kept their adrenaline high. Unfortunately for me, I ticked none of those boxes and it was very evident. And that was the thing put a target on my back.",
        "In the midst of all of it all, I tried to find extracurricular activities where I was hoping to meet like-minded individuals and drama club seems to be the one that resonated with me the most. It was a bit funny because all the other \"weird\" and socially awkward, and smart people were part of it. It became a safe space and it was truly a judgement free zone. I realized that I enjoyed portraying other people's realities, for the same reasons I enjoyed playing and becoming different characters as a child, but it also became a place where I could express myself, my thoughts and my feels through these embodiments of these different characters. I realized that it was liberating and freeing for me because I could say what I felt and what I was thinking, and no one would think it came from me because it was being said by the characters. I also realized that as humans, we experiences a lot of similar traumas and that we go through similar situations, and for me I thought embodying these different characters and telling these stories would make other people feel seen as well. It was for these reasons as well where I started imagining myself studying theatre, because of what we would learn in the drama club. I fell in love with it to the point where I did dramatic arts as a subject in Grade 11, after dropping physical sciences. But despite having had this safe space, I still could not be myself, outside of that environment."

        "When you have tasted illness too often, and lived to smell the aftermath, the relationship you have with your body never really feels stable. But when I was eventually able to start taking testosterone, it felt like I was embodying my flesh for the very first time. I banked on having a full beard by the time I finished my first vial, but within two weeks my patience was obliterated. I wanted facial hair now, that very moment. I still do. No one really tells you how your features will emerge, just that it is â€˜different for everyoneâ€™. My favourite facial feature is my nose; itâ€™s finally as broad as my motherâ€™s. The less delicate my features become, the more people stare at me. It is like I was being registered as myself for the very first time. Still, no matter how visibly myself I have become, at the end of each day I return home and face my ancestry in the mirror. The lineament on my brow is my fathers; this I can say without doubt. The hair on my toes hasnâ€™t changed much, itâ€™s always been there to remind me of my motherâ€™s mother, of her androgynous divinity. When I smile, my eyes shine with the sun her soul left behind. Someone must carry the joy forward.",
        "I have acne mapped like stars along my jawline, which gets inflamed if I donâ€™t get to take my dose each week as prescribed. As time passes, I realise itâ€™s just the precursor to my facial hair. There are thick random stray strands, and then there are patches of thick hair that you canâ€™t really see unless youâ€™re up close to me. On my chin, there is a single black strand that curls and points back to my jugular. When I am thinking, I stroke my face and play with the fluff. I think back to how I would lather my face with my grandfatherâ€™s shaving cream in the shower before my first puberty ruptured my spirit. and with the backside of the razor, I drag streaks through the white foam and lean closer into the mirror as I scan my face for any changes. Nothing. Now when I shave, I look like a young teenage boy, even though Iâ€™ve just turned twenty-four and my spirit feels about sixty. I get asked for my ID when Iâ€™m trying to buy cigarettes at the Tops, or when I walk into a bar to play some pool. So, I leave my stache on my top lip and trim it as neat as I possibly can. Hair has started sprouting from my bottom lip and down my neck. It hurts my skin to shave, so I do it as seldom as possible now. Puberty still sucks, maybe just a little less than when youâ€™re a teenager.",
        "Even with all the exterior changes, nothing splayed itself inside my mind more than what the testosterone was doing to the platelets in my blood. They say that joy lives in your blood, that it travels and makes itself at home in your bloodstream. The internet says that depo-testosterone increases platelet activity; this increases the chance of blood clots, but luckily for me I need this boost. After my first round of blood tests, my doctor tells me that the platelets are back up to 150 000 per microliter of my blood. I choke on my tongue when she breaks the news. Itâ€™s not been so high since I was diagnosed. Even after the chemotherapy treatment, my platelet counts never exceeded 80 000. It just so happened that I would start HRT, and stumble to discover a cure to my internal bleeding. The more joy I let myself express, the more I heal. I blossom from the inside out and carry my journey with pride. I wear my skin like a king, and I get to keep my spleen (for now).",
        "Every part of my flesh tells a story, and testosterone has further unsettled the sequence of these stories. What takes place in my body is not merely transformation, but a revival of the joy I lost in clumps and strands along the way. Where the stream of joy was intermittent before, it is robust now. This is chemical and spiritual, it is a testimony to all the little moments of joy which have survived with me to this point. My gender expression is a part of my retribution. My body is a living story of my illness and survivorship but also a living archive that demonstrates the spirituality of gender. But at first glance, this isnâ€™t obvious. The entire world can have a series of full-frontals of my naked body, but no one will entirely understand the experiences marked inch by inch in my flesh. I could pose and you will see the muscle in my limbs, the strength in my core, but would you be able to say what it took to mend this? Would you be able to tell how fresh my poise is? Are you able to map the scars of my survival, or the blossoms of my joy?"

        "We Inherit the Fire by Kagiso Lesego Molope â€“ A Personal Review (Fazila Cariem)",
        "I wanted to read this book simply because I was drawn to the title. It speaks of generational cycles and emotions we fuel simply because they form the baseline of our history. And I was curious to find out whether the author would have demonstrated how to extract the good from the bad and find a place of peace beyond the turmoil. The cover â€“ two hands intertwined with different colour markings symbolized the deep cultural roots and the story did not disappoint.",
        "The plot itself is deceptively simple. Molope presents the relationship between a celebrated anti-apartheid freedom fighter and her daughter, exposing the fractures beneath the public mythology.",
        "The story is about Kewame, who had been imprisoned during Apartheid as a child for four years. She grows up and marries a man who sees her less as a partner than as a testament to his own virtue, a struggle trophy rather than a woman in need of love. He never truly offers the healing, companionship, or emotional refuge that a marriage at that stage of her life should have provided. Instead, he remains closed off, and at times his resentment surfaces, as though her survival and sacrifice cast an uncomfortable light on the comforts he never had to earn.",
        "Despite this, they end up having four daughters. One of the daughters, Kelelo, is quiet but extremely observant. She desperately seeks the softness and nurture of her mother only to be met with one who is disconnected from reality. What interested me most was the tension between the Kewameâ€™s public identity and her private reality. She occupies an almost sacred space as a \"Mother of the Nation\" figure, admired, respected, even mythologized by those around her. Yet on the intimate, family level, she is emotionally unavailable, disconnected, and deeply unhealed.",
        "A defining turning point in Kelelo's life comes when she is forced to leave her township school and join her sisters at a school in the suburbs. There, racial microaggressions become woven into the fabric of her daily existence, subtle enough to be dismissed, yet constant enough to leave scars. Determined not to be seen as difficult or angry, and haunted by the fear of becoming like her mother, Kelelo learns to swallow her questions, silence her objections, and endure what she knows is wrong. In the process, she suppresses not only her voice, but a vital part of herself.",

        "Set against the backdrop of Soweto and Lesotho, Wisani and the Bafokeng Brothers follows Wisani Maluleke, a student at Wits University who is juggling three jobs to keep the lights on while caring for her bedridden mother and younger brother. Life in Soweto has made her resilient, but she's stretched to breaking point until her research project leads her to the Bafokeng brothers, heirs to the feared and Legendary Marashea underworld.",

Between survival, love, and the weight of her familyâ€™s struggles, Wisani must decide whether to walk away or stand with the brothers who could destroy her or save her.",

Throughout the novel, loyalty influences every relationship and decision, often demanding sacrifice and changing the course of the charactersâ€™ lives. Combined with the themes of love, family, responsibility, danger, and surviving, it makes for an incredibly compelling read."

        "My dad has dementia, and because I live in a different city from him, I'm caring for him from a distance â€“ the kind of quiet, constant worry that doesn't switch off. So when I attended Qaanitah Hunter's book launch for Why Am I Like This and realised her newest novel had similar themes to what I was going through, I knew I had to get my hands on it before I'd even left the room.",
        "Hunter, South Africa's hard-hitting political journalist and creator of The Debrief Network, is no stranger to writing fiction.",
        "Her first book, Diary of a Guji Girl, gained a cult following for the honest and humorous way it captured the life of a young South African Muslim woman â€“ particularly how Amina, a first-year student from the small town of Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal, navigates campus life, friendships, the pressure from family to marry, and all the unspoken rules of her culture and community.",
        "Diary of a Guji Girl was one of the first books where I saw my own world on the page. At the time, there weren't many stories out there about South African Muslim Gujarati women, written from inside that world with all its specific slang and traditions. There's also an easy, chatty quality to Qaanitah's writing that pulled me in. She doesn't try to sound literary; she just tells it like it is, and that's exactly why Diary of a Guji Girl and her other work are well-received.",
        "Although Why Am I Like This is Hunter's second work of fiction, it is not her second book overall. She's also published several non-fiction titles on South African politics, including Who Will Rule South Africa? (co-authored by Adriaan Basson) and Eight Days In July: Inside The Zuma Unrest That Set South Africa Alight (co-authored by Kaveel Singh, Jeff Wicks). Considering all of this, I had high expectations for Hunterâ€™s new novel."

        "Over the years, he had learned to hate himself. He hated how his paunch protruded beyond his ribcage, a clear distraction from his strong legs and chiselled arms. The bags around his eyes were darker, outlined with cracks that snaked around in unison. A hairline is not a hairline if there is no hair. Where had the volume gone to, he thought.",

He had once been a teacher, then a carpenter â€“ a real handyman doing what he could. People said he was a man who saw light where others only saw walls. He dreamed of possibilities and fulfilled potentials. Armed with love, with plenty more optimism and hope to go around.",

Following behind were surveyors, developers, future owners â€“ in all smiles and sunglasses, lattes in hand, and title deeds held tightly in the other. To them, the earth was nothing but ERF.",

She was an elderly woman who had lived in the community all her life. She had baked for the streets for close to forty years. A generous soul. Like Abraham, a pair of genuinely good Samaritans.",

        "â€œBe here now!â€ said the man and ended the call."
